# Solar Energy Web Application

This web application allows users to estimate solar energy potential by analyzing building rooftops using geospatial data and machine learning models. It provides an interactive dashboard, OpenStreetMap with a search feature, and street view functionality. Users can draw shapes on the map, search for locations, and get energy reports.

## Features
- Dashboard to visualize solar energy potential and financial metrics.
- Full-screen OpenStreetMap integration with drawing tools.
- Toggle between OpenStreetMap and Google Street View.
- PDF export functionality for energy analysis reports.
- Search functionality to find specific locations on the map.
- Dropdown menu to choose between different use cases like agriculture, IT, industry, and domestic.
  
## Installation
To install and run the web application locally, follow the steps in the `INSTALL.md` file.

## File Structure
- `index.html` – The home page of the application.
